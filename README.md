For this assignment, I decided to create circles that 'moves to the beat', in other words, circles that grow big and shrink while the music is played. I did face minor issues with the change in background colour and size of circles but eventually got a hang of it.Â 

I want to create an environment that somewhat reflects on disco party with upbeat songs while maintaining a minimalist nature. That is why I went ahead with just circles popping at random positions using random().

I chose the song 'Unpredictable' by the Japanese singer-songwriter, Ayumu Imazu. I got my design inspiration while listening to this song and formed a basic visualization of how my final output was going to be.
